# Lost my Head

Oh no! Help! I've lost my head! Can you tell me the street name of the trash bin I lost it in? Maybe I can still find it...

## Solving
Like always we should first check `strings`, `file` and so on.
Please see the logfiles.

In the `exif` we can find some coordinates. These coordinates will bring us to romania.

> 46°46'50.7"N 23°36'54.3"E

The trashcans look similar to the pitcure.
