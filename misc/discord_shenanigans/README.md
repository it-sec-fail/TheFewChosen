# DISCORD SHENANIGANS
We considered giving you a free flag. However, we decided against it. In general, we would never do that! Or would we? That's the beginning of a good CTF! Discord is the new Twitter.

To be able to solve this challenge, you'll need to join our discord. Link in the Rules page.

## Todos
The flag is hidden in the discord of the organizer. It should be in general, because of the hints from the text ;)
There was a discussion:

So this should be anything...
